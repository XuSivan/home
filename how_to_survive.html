			<h1><center>How to survive</center></h1>
			<center>Using materials such as <a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Leather">Leather</a>, <a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron">Iron</a>, <a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold">Gold</a>, or <a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Diamonds">Diamonds</a>, you can make armour.</center>
			<img src = "images\armour.jpg" width = "709" height = "432" alt = "armour">
		</body>
		<body>
			<center>Some of these armours can be attained by <a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mobs">mobs</a>, but these armours aren't nescessarily needed to survive.</center>
		</body>
		<body>
			<center>To craft these items, you require a <a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Crafting_Table">crafting table</a>, in which you can make armour by placing the materials like so.</a></center>

		</body>
		<body>
			<center>You now can defend yourself against mobs, but you need to fight back. To make a <a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sword">sword</a>, 
			you require <a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wood">wood</a>, <a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Leather">iron</a>, 
			<a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold">gold</a>, 
			or <a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Diamond">diamonds</a>.</center>
			<center>But in order to get those items, you need a <a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe">pickaxe</a> for ores, and an <a href = "https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Axe">axe</a> to obtain the wood. </center>
			<center>To craft a sword, you place the items like so on a crafting table</center>
			<img src = "images\sword.gif" width = "348" height = "162" alt = "sword"/>
			<center>To craft the pickaxe, you place the items like so on a crafting table.</center>
			<img src = "images\pickaxe.gif" width = "348" height = "162" alt = "pickaxe"/>
			<center>To craft the axe, you place the items like so on a crafting table.</center>
			<img src = "images\axe.gif" width = "348" height = "162" alt = "axe"/>

			<center>Good Job! Now you know how you can defend yourself against mobs, but since you don't know what a mob is and isn't. If you want to know, <a href = "mobs.html">continue</a>.</center>
